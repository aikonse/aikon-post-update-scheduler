# Aikon Post Update Scheduler
WordPress plugin to schedule content updates for any page or post type.

## Description
WordPress lacks the ability to schedule content updates. Manually updating your posts and pages can be a waste of time, especially if you know you'll have to update the same page again soon.

Inspired by [content-update-scheduler](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-update-scheduler/) and [tao-schedule-update](https://github.com/tao-software/tao-schedule-update) plugins.
